A generic OSC based prompt for inspecting and manipulating clients.

Prompt accepts:
 - TAB
 - disconnect
 - quit
 - exit
 - connect 'port number'
 - general OSC messages sent to the client

It assumes that the client will respond to /path-search:ss for tab completion
and field information.

This is currently Beta software and as such expect some interesting behavior
from time to time.
Discussion and bug reports are appreciated.

To build, make sure liblo is installed on the system, the rtosc submodule is
checked out (via git submodule update --init), and then use cmake (typically
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make is what you'd want).
